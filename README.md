# IU_CyberDefense
This repository contains all the submissions I made for the Cyber Defense course I took at IU Bloomington.

## Summary
This course was completely lab-based, and a totally new experience for me, academically, and throughout the semester we had hands-on in-lab hacking experience. We focused on learning/implementing practical offensive security skills related to reverse engineering, web testing, binary exploitation, cryptography, etc. Through a combination of interactive lectures, labs, graduate research presentations, and guest speakers, this course offered me the chance to explore some of the most technically challenging and cutting edge subjects in security. The subject matter apart from the concepts listed below, covered techniques for adapting to novel architectures and challenges, as well. More than 90% of the crowd that have taken this course, statistically, have had decent to great chances to not only represent IU, but also participate in various public Capture-The-Flag (CTF) and Cyber Defense competitions.
